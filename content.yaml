# About Me Section
about:
  paragraphs:
    - "I'm a Senior Product Manager - Technical at AWS, where I work on product strategy and execution for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). With deep expertise in cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, AI, and large-scale distributed systems, I've driven the development of groundbreaking features that enable customers to run Kubernetes at unprecedented scale and complexity."
    
    - "My work spans the intersection of technical innovation and business impact. From launching one of the largest Kubernetes clusters supporting 100,000 nodes for frontier AI/ML workloads, to pioneering GenAI developer experiences with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, to architecting next-generation Kubernetes control plane capabilities - I focus on solving complex technical challenges that deliver measurable customer value."
    
    - "I bring a unique combination of technical depth in Kubernetes, AWS services, and system architecture, paired with strong product management skills in roadmap planning, stakeholder alignment, and go-to-market strategy. I've successfully launched AWS services and features, including AWS CodeArtifact, and have driven strategic initiatives that have resulted in significant product experience improvements and differentiation for various AWS services like Amazon EKS, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Lambda@Edge, and AWS Developer Tools."
